Learning ES6 and React JS 

Current version of the codebase reflects the current lesson I am working through. Each commit usually overwrites the previous lessons work. Each commit shows the skills and lessons learned to better access each skill.

Depending on the outcome of the training, I may revise this to have a subdirectory for each lesson completed.
